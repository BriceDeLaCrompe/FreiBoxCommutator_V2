# FreiBoxCommutator_V2

In this version, we changed the 3d-printed design of the FreiBox commutator to facilitate the assembly and reduce the noise. the 3D-printed gears have been replaced by a timing pulley system.

Since the detection principle and the Arduino Code is the same as for v1, please check our previous version on Github and our paper:
