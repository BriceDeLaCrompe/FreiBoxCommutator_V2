# FreiBoxCommutator_V2

In this version, we changed the 3d-printed design of the FreiBox commutator to facilitate the assembly and reduce the noise. the 3D-printed gears have been replaced by a timing pulley system.

Since the detection principle and the Arduino Code is the same as for v1, please check our previous version on Github and don't forget to cite our paper:

/!\ To assemble the commutator, please check first the 'FreiBoxCommutator_V2 _AssemblyInstruction.pptx'

Don't hesitate to tell me if you have an idea to improve the design! I will be happy to have comments from you.

Note concerning the electronic circuit:
If you don't want to solder the electronic circuit yourself, you can directly use a motor driver shield.
