# FreiBoxCommutator_V2

In this version, we changed the 3d-printed design of the FreiBox commutator to facilitate the assembly. To reduce the noise, we changed the 3D-printed gears buy a timing pulley system.
However, the detection principle and the Arduino Code is the same as for v1.

Check the 'FreiBoxCommutator_V2 _AssemblyInstruction.pptx' to assemble the commutator!


For the previous version please check our paper and the commutator V1 (https://github.com/Optophys-Lab/FreiBox/tree/main/Commutator_FreiBox2022)
